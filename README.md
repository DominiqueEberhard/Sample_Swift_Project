# Sample_Swift_Project
This is a project that contains the files of my portion of a project that I did with my brother. I busied myself with the design components and look and feel of the app. To do this, I had to learn Swift, SwiftUI and Adobe Illustrator in order create the visual assets. I also had to improvise and learn how XML works in order to help me translate XML files to "paths" in SwiftUI. I even used my previous Audio Engineering skills to record and process the audio assets. Overall, I made an animated "splash screen" as well as animated loading screens. To get an idea of what it is supposed to look like, I recommend running the "ContentViewTest" file in Xcode.
